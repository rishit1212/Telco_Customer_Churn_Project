Telco Customer Churn Analysis<br /> 
This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a telecom company, focusing on identifying key factors driving churn and recommending strategies to improve customer retention. The analysis leverages Python for data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and actionable insights.<br /> 
<br /> 
Key Objectives:-<br /> 
Understand the impact of contract types, payment methods, and customer tenure on churn rates.<br /> 
Identify high-risk customer segments based on demographic and behavioral factors.<br /> 
Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.<br /> 
<br /> <br /> 
Insights & Findings:-<br /> 
Contract Types: Customers with month-to-month contracts have a 42% churn rate, significantly higher than yearly (11%) and two-year contracts (3%).<br /> 
Payment Methods: Electronic check users are most likely to churn (45%), compared to 15-18% for credit card and bank transfer users.<br /> 
Customer Tenure: Churn is highest (50%) for customers with less than one year of tenure, emphasizing the importance of early engagement.<br /> 
Demographics: Senior citizens have a higher churn rate (41%) compared to non-senior customers (26%).<br /> 
<br /> 
Tools & Techniques:-<br /> 
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and ensured data consistency using Pandas.<br /> 
Visualization: Created bar plots, line graphs, and churn heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.<br /> 
Statistical Analysis: Evaluated trends and churn patterns across different variables to identify key drivers of churn.<br /> 
<br /> 
Recommendations:-<br /> 
Promote long-term contracts to improve retention.<br /> 
Encourage transitions from electronic checks to more secure payment methods.<br /> 
Focus on personalized engagement strategies for new customers and senior citizens.<br /> 
<br /> 
Technologies Used:-<br /> 
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)<br /> 
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization<br /> 

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support targeted strategies to minimize churn and enhance customer loyalty.
