Telco Customer Churn Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a telecom company, focusing on identifying key factors driving churn and recommending strategies to improve customer retention. The analysis leverages Python for data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and actionable insights.

Key Objectives:-
Understand the impact of contract types, payment methods, and customer tenure on churn rates.
Identify high-risk customer segments based on demographic and behavioral factors.
Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

Insights & Findings:-
Contract Types: Customers with month-to-month contracts have a 42% churn rate, significantly higher than yearly (11%) and two-year contracts (3%).
Payment Methods: Electronic check users are most likely to churn (45%), compared to 15-18% for credit card and bank transfer users.
Customer Tenure: Churn is highest (50%) for customers with less than one year of tenure, emphasizing the importance of early engagement.
Demographics: Senior citizens have a higher churn rate (41%) compared to non-senior customers (26%).

Tools & Techniques:-
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and ensured data consistency using Pandas.
Visualization: Created bar plots, line graphs, and churn heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Statistical Analysis: Evaluated trends and churn patterns across different variables to identify key drivers of churn.

Recommendations:-
Promote long-term contracts to improve retention.
Encourage transitions from electronic checks to more secure payment methods.
Focus on personalized engagement strategies for new customers and senior citizens.

Technologies Used:-
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support targeted strategies to minimize churn and enhance customer loyalty.
